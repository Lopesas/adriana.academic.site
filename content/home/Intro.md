Photosynthesis, the biological process of transforming solar energy into biomass, has forged our planet as we know it. The machinery of photosynthesis absorbs and uses solar energy to separate the water into its component parts, oxygen and hydrogen, and the chemical energy to convert the CO2 (carbon dioxide) sequestrated out of the atmosphere into sugars (biomass). This biological process is called primary productivity and it is performed by organisms called photosynthesizers, such as plants. 
The products of photosynthesis, water and sugar, are essential to all forms of life we know, and so is oxygen to most of the living beings on planet.  Ocean and the land share, almost equally, the primary production of the Earth.  Due to our terrestrial nature as human beings, it is very easy to spot how dependent we are of the plants, of our crops to live, but in the ocean, who is feeding all the animals, who is sustaining the trophic web? 
In the Oceans, microscopic photosynthesizes cells from the sunlit ocean layer, called phytoplankton,  feed the entire open ocean ecosystem (marine food web) and produce half of the oxygen we consume. Phytoplankton is a functional group of single cell organisms including cyanobacteria and eukaryotes that can perform oxygenic photosynthesis. The eukaryotic compartment of phytoplankton harbors a wide diversity of organisms that are distributed widely across several branches of eukaryotic tree of life. 
My research is focused on understanding and characterizing these organisms. The smallest ones (average size 2 - 3 Âµm = 1000x smaller than a pin head) fascinate me especially as life can be so efficient and elegant at such small scales.
How diverse these cells are? How are they distributed in the oceans? How each group of phytoplankton contribute to the primary productivity in the ocean? How do they respond to limiting growth factors, such as nutrient and light? These are questions I have addressed during the last years and want to continue addressing in the future by combining different methodologies such as classical cultivation and isolation methods and cutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies, such as metabarcoding and metatranscriptomics. 
If you are interested in learning more about marine phytoplankton and the work we are developing, please explore this site and feel free to drop an [email](mailto:a driana.lopes@ntu.edu.sg) with any questions.
