Picophytoplankton Study of Carbon rates in Oligotrophic waters of the South Pacific and Atlantic Oceans aims to obtain detailed information on the diversity and production of eukaryotic picophytoplankton in the South Pacific. We will combine a range of state of the art techniques including metabarcoding of marker genes, C14 productivity measurements on flow cytometry sorted populations, electron microscopy coupled with in situ probe hybridization and high throughput culture isolation using flow cytometry sorting. 
The South part of the Pacific Ocean is under-sampled oceanic region. It harbors mesotrophic and oligotrophic areas which primary production is dominated by very small eukaryotic cells less than 2-3 μm (pico-phytoplankton). Despite their ecological importance, many of these organisms are still uncultured and their morphology and physiology unknown. If offshore tropical waters become more oligotrophic in response to global change, as predicted, a shift in the size class dominance may very well take place among the groups of phytoplankton, and the small photosynthetic eukaryotes might become dominant.  Understanding the contributions of the different groups of pico – phytoplankton to the carbon cycle, their ecology and physiology is fundamental for choosing the appropriate parameters to model primary production in the future oceans.
