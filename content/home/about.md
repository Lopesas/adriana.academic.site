Photosynthesis, the biological process of transforming solar energy into biomass, had transformed and changed our planet to what we know today. The machinery of photosynthesis absorbs and uses solar energy to separate the water into its component parts, oxygen and hydrogen, and the chemical energy produced to sequestrated CO2 (carbon dioxide) out of the atmosphere into sugars. This process is called primary productivity. 

The products of photosynthesis, water and sugar are essential to all forms of life we know and oxygen to most of us on earth.  Ocean and the land share, almost equally, the task of keeping the total primary production of the Earth.  On land, we all know how dependent we are of the plants, of our crops, to live but in the ocean, who is feeding all the animals in the ocean? 

In the Ocean, there is an invisible pasture as Penny Chisholm says. Microscopic photosynthesizes cells, called phytoplankton. From the sunlit ocean layer, these tiny producers feed the entire open ocean ecosystem and produce half of the oxygen we consume. 

My research is focused in understanding and characterizing these organisms, the marine phytoplankton. Specially, the tiny ones (average size 2 - 3Âµm) fascinate me as life can be so efficient and so compact. 

How diverse these cells are? How they are distributed in the oceans? How each group of phytoplankton contribute to the primary productivity in the ocean? How they respond to the limiting growth factors they face in the ocean, such as nutrient and light limitation? These are questions I have addressed during the last years and want to address in the future by combining different methodologies including classical methods such as cultivation and isolation and Omics. 

I believe an interdisciplinary, open and collaborative science can only bring solid knowledge and a better understating of the world we live.
