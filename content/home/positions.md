## Ph.D. student in Earth Science with focus in Marine Ecology
 
We are looking for a curious and driven Ph.D. student to join our team! The student will be at the forefront of a project research that aims to unveil the dynamics and contribution of small (pico) oceanic eukaryotic phytoplankton to the carbon cycle. We will combine classical primary productivity experiments with phytoplankton population sorting and metabarcoding (metaB) of marker gene to access group specific contribution to carbon fixation.  In order track the variation of phytoplankton communities’ abundances and their metabolism in situ, we will perform high-resolution sampling through their natural diel-cycle in different water masses and apply meta transcriptomic (metaT) data analysis to examine the pathways that lead to nutrient acquisition and growth of key picoplanktonic species.  
The project will involve field and laboratory studies. 

Lab experience and/or computing skills will be considered favorably.  Geeks with love for microbes are welcome! 


**Program**

The Asian School of the Environment (ASE) is part of the Nanyang technological University (NTU). Nanyang Technological University is a young and research-driven university, ranked 12th globally by the QS World University Rankings. 

The ASE is an interdisciplinary School research focusing on Asian environmental challenges. The ASE integrates earth and environmental life science, ecology, engineering and technology, human ecology, humanities, and the social sciences to address key issues of the environment and sustainability. The Ph.D is designed to be completed with 4 years of study
  

**Criteria from Asian School of Environment**

The minimum requirement for admission is a Bachelor’s degree with 2nd Class Honors Upper.

All applicants are required to submit their GRE or GATE test scores which must be within 5 years or less from the date of application. Special arrangements can be made for selected applicants to sit for Technical Proficiency Test (TPT) in place of GRE.
