# Diversity and oceanic distribution of marine phytoplankton

Changes in marine plankton communities driven by environmental variability ultimately impact the marine food web and global biogeochemical cycles (pathway by which a chemical substance moves through biotic and abiotic compartments of Earth). To predict and assess community shifts and their consequences, we first need to determine the composition of these communities and how they change along environmental and biological gradients, for example latitude or temperature. 

With the advent of molecular biology methods such as high throughput sequence of gene markers (metabarcoding) and increase number of sequence dataset, access global scale distribution of your favorite bug using metabarcoding became more feasible. Basic after acquiring your sequence data either in the lab or through public databases, all you need is to determine which sequence belongs to which bug, like sorting the sequences into boxes where each represents different individuals. The changeling is to determine the individual units and their close relatives, so you donâ€™t end up sorting the sequences into the wrong box. 

One language we all use in biology is the one provided by taxonomy where the individuals are categorized into species, the different species into genera, etc. Often the combination of taxonomy and metabarcoding method brings interesting insights into marine phytoplankton distribution and ecology. Bellow two examples. 


## Bolidophyceae, the sister group of diatoms
Bolidophyceae is a group of eukaryotes that contains species with cells surrounded by silica plates (Parmales, A) as well as naked flagellated species (formerly Bolidomonadales, B). They are of particular interest given its close evolutionary relationship to the diatoms, one of the most successful groups of the phytoplankton.  
In our study ( [Ichinomiya and Lopes dos Santos et al., 2016](files/publications/ 2016-01-01_Diversity_and_oceani.md) ) we first used sequence data from strains to analyze the evolutionary relationships among several silicified and flagellated strains isolated from different oceanic regions. We were able to show that the silica covered cells (Parmales) actually belong to the same Class (Bolidophyceae) of the naked flagellated cells (previously called Bolidomonas) indicating that Bolidophyceae group can occur in two different cells forms (heteromorphic) possible during different life stages.
